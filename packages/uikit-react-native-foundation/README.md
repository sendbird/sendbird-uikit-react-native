# @sendbird/uikit-react-native-foundation

A foundational UI kit for building chat-enabled React Native apps.

This package is created and published for the dependency of UIKit for React-Native.
Therefore, we do not guarantee that this package will work in other environments.
If you use this package outside of UIKit for React-Native and encounter any issues, you will need to handle them on your own.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @sendbird/uikit-react-native-foundation react-native-safe-area-context
```

(Optional) If you want use [`react-native-fast-image`](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) instead of default Image component

```sh
npm i react-native-fast-image
```
