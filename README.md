## Development

We tried development on macOS / Linux systems. You might encounter problems in running sample or scripts like `yarn build` in Windows machines. We are using sample app for development, you can check the sample app [here](/sample) and also check the UI components via storybook in the sample app.

### Run sample app

```shell
yarn install
npx pod-install

yarn sample:android
yarn sample:ios
```

### Creating a new key function files

Run the script and enter the key function name as a lower camel case like `groupChannel`, and then you can see the auto generated files in the `/packages/uikit-react-native/src/domain`

```shell
yarn workspace @sendbird/uikit-react-native run create-domain
```

### Managing repository

> **Note**
> We are using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to maintain this monorepo

#### Package dependencies

See [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspace)

```shell
# Add dependency to specific workspace package
yarn workspace @sendbird/package add package-name
# Remove dependency from specific workspace package
yarn workspace @sendbird/package remove package-name

# Add dependency to root
yarn workspace -W add package-name
```

> **Warning** You should better install to root if you're trying to install native view modules.
> Sometimes native view module in the workspace is not hoisted, and it leads to `Tried to register two views` error on the sample app.

#### Bump version

See [lerna version](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/version)

```shell
lerna version {major|minor|patch} [--no-git-tag-version] [--no-private]

# or

yarn bump:{major|minor|patch}
```

#### Publish

See [lerna publish](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/publish)
