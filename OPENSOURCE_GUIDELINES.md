# Sendbird UIKit Open Source Guidelines
​
Sendbird is excited to share UIKit to the open source community in order to speed up the go-to-market strategy for our customers. We’ve already seen how UIKit enables you to go to market with ease, but now we want to provide you with the flexibility to fine tune UIKit for your own market needs.
​
This community guideline outlines Sendbird’s stance on open source and explains how you can take advantage of UIKit’s open source.
​
*   We recommend you to use UIKit open source only if the standard UIKit SDK does not suit your use case. This includes if you’d like to use a Sendbird Chat SDK feature that is currently unavailable in UIKit.
*   We will provide limited support should you choose to use our open source code and fork it (clone and edit the code in your own repository) because we won’t be able to transparently understand the code.
*   We don’t accept direct contributions to the source code. If you discover a bug or would like to suggest improvements to the source code, you can share them in the [Sendbird Community UIKit forum](https://community.sendbird.com/c/sendbird-chat-uikit/)).
